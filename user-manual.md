### What is "my style"?

I'm chill. I try not to panic. I'll often imagine the worst case scenario for
any given situation so that I can plan for it. I have a daily "human interaction
time limit" that I sometimes hit. If I seem irritable, I apologize. I
probably need to take a break, take a walk, and recharge.


### What do I value?

I value open-mindedness, collaboration, honest feedback,
[positive thinking](https://nesslabs.com/pygmalion-effect),
sharing knowledge, and being kind.


### What donâ€™t I have patience for?

I don't have patience for ignorance shaming, pretension, or judgmental
points-of-view.


### How can you communicate best with me?

Email, SMS Text, and
[Messaging Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_apps#Popular_messaging_applications)
are great for asynchronous communication. I enjoy having the
illusion of control over my schedule, so if you want to talk for more than a
few minutes, let's schedule a time to chat.
I keep [my calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=cmRhdmlzLmJhY3NAZ21haWwuY29t)
up-to-date and I'm always keeping tabs on good spots to grab coffee.

"Headphones on" means I'm "heads-down working." I probably don't want to talk
about my weekend, right now. However, if you have something urgent and important
that needs my immediate attention, please interrupt me.


### How can you help me?

Help me to see the alternatives. I'm sure I have not considered every possibility.
How does the situation look from your perspective? Help me to see the desired
outcomes and tell me your current concerns.


### What do people misunderstand about me?

People often think I'm angry when I'm simply in a mode of quiet contemplation.
I'm an introvert. I live quite a bit in my own brain. It may take me a moment
to organize my thoughts when I'm verbally expressing what I'm thinking.
I sometimes stop mid-sentence to ensure I'm using the correct vocabulary in
order to most clearly express my ideas.
