1. A `develop` branch is created from `master`
2. A `release` branch is created from `develop`
3. `feature` branches are created from `develop`
4. When a `feature` is complete it is merged into the `develop` branch
5. When the `release` branch is done it is merged into `develop` and `master`
6. If an issue in `master` is detected a `hotfix` branch is created from `master`
7. Once the `hotfix` is complete it is merged to both `develop` and `master`
