* [x] Tastes like the scared urine of a rabbit.
* [x] It's like Steven Segal's pre-cum.
* [x] If a nickel could urniate, it would taste like Bud Light.
* [x] Tastes like the ghost of a dead lemon.
* [x] It's basically like if water could go bad.
* [x] It tastes like if a raccoon ejaculated carbonated vinegar inside of an old log.
* [x] Tastes like butter churned by Boko Haram.
* [x] It's like someone drank a good Mexican beer and pissed in this bottle.
* [x] It's like a cloud rained the tears of a sick child.
* [x] It's like making a tea out of dipping Scott Caan's balls in water.
* [x] Tastes like all the used bronzer in Wildwood, NJ.
* [x] It tastes like Robert Durst's aquarium.
* [x] It tastes like antifreeze that's been filtered through a used yoga mat.
