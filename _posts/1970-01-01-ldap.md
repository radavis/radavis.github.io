The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral,
industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed
directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Directory
services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications
by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services,
and applications throughout the network.
