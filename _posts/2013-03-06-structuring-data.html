<p>I recently took a Data Structures course and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plus-Data-Structures-Nell-Dale/dp/0763704814">the required textbook</a>Â was, to put it mildly, abysmal. The author's grasp of the language is shaky, the examples suck, and the explanations of the concepts go on and on. I can't believe I paid for this. I checked out the first edition (published in '99) and besides some color and font tweaks, nothing has changed!</p>
<p>Luckily, an awesome human being decided to release his Data Structures textbook as a pdf, free to the world, and, it's good. Explanations are concise and to the point and the use of the language is solid. Plus, you have your choice of C++ and Java versions of the text. While you're there, check out the AlgoViz.org link for lots of visual examples on how your favorite algorithms work.</p>
