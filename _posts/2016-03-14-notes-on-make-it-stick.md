## Poor strategies for learning

* Rereading
* Massed practice (cramming for an exam)

## Effective strategies for learning

* Retrieval practice - recalling from memory
  - flashcards
  - simple test after reading or lecture
* Space out practice
* Interleave practice of two or more subjects
* Attempt to solve the problem before being taught the solution
* Elaboration - expressing a concept in your own words

"Making mistakes and correcting them build the bridges to advanced learning."
